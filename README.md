# lsma: Landscape Structure Multiscale Analysis

`lsma` is an R package designed to perform multi-scale landscape analysis. It provides tools to decouple nested spatial patterns and assess landscape metrics, helping landscape ecologists and conservation scientists analyze spatial data efficiently.

## Features

- Tools for calculating landscape metrics across multiple scales.
- Nested and decoupled approaches for landscape analysis.
- Integration with `raster`, `sf`, and `lsma` for handling spatial and raster data.
- Experimental support for parallel processing using the `future` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `lsma` from GitHub:
Always check the line below:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wilsonfrantine/lsma@refactor-v1")
```

## How to Use

Three simple steps to analyze your data:
1. Load the raster data, sampling points and set your buffer sizes
2. Choose the best strategy for your experiment (coupled, decoupled, decouple_single)
3. Calculate the metric for each scale with calculate_metrics() from any landscapemetrics package function

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

    library(lsma)
    
    # Load example raster and points
    r <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata/raster.grd", package = "landscapeDecoupler"))
    p <- terra::vect(sf::st_read(system.file("extdata/pnts.shp", package = "landscapeDecoupler"), quiet = TRUE))
    
    # Extract landscapes
    ls <- extract_landscapes(r, p, buffers = c(500, 1000, 2000), strategy = "nested")
    
    # Visualize
    view_ls(ls)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    metrics <- calculate_metrics(ls, metric = "pland", level = "class")
    
    # Fit models
    models <- multimodel(metrics, bio_data = data_frame, model_type = "lm", model_formula = "responses ~ predictors")

The package also has functions to plot the extracted scales for visual check and publication, as well as basic metric plots.
